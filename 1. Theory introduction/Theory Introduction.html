              <p align="justify" class="style16">This project proposes that the entire cortex has  a complex dipole structure. If you do not know what a dipole is, it would be  recommended you read the short beginners tutorial first.<a href="../__Pages/What is a dipole.html"> <span class="style67">(link above &quot;What is a dipole&quot;) </span></a><span class="style67"><a href="../5. What is a dipole/What is a dipole.html"></a></span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><span class="style15"><img src="images/text-book.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="402"></span></p>
              <p align="center" class="style63">Can you spot the similarities between these two images ? </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68">Dipole neurology, the  concept of electromagnetic structure as the key to unlocking brain structure,  is about seeing  the structure, function and disorder of the brain in the context of its evolution with natural laws of physics. &nbsp;The current summary of the project is <a href="../2. Theory Background/TheorySummary.html"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15">RESEARCH SCOPE AND RELEVANCE</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The dipole view of the brain, is not like conventional  areas explored in neuroscience, such as frontal lobe wiring, social instincts, or finding a new neural protein.<em> </em>It is  an overarching technical view, that  begins with  cognitive neuroscience and goes of into contraversial territory quite far removed from anywhere neuroscience has been previously.  </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">If the brain is looked at from the  view of a complete electromagnetic formation and its parts and structures as part  of that, then the disorders, development and functions of the brain can be reframed in a  completely new light. This way of  thinking about the brain would be similar to the geoscience approach to our planet <em>(also a complex dipole)</em> where the oceans, geology, ecosystem and ionosphere are seen as  components of a complex electromagnetic system.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Since the idea here is to take a large scale look through the whole brain, it is obviously not possible to be so  rigorous, in every part. Current medical research dedicates teams and massive resources just to each of many thousands of neural components. <span class="style63 style68"> Each of these studies produces more questions, more proteins etc. So science is still not that receptive to projects that propose they can put a lof of stuff together. The emphasis is still on a break it all apart approach but looks to be changing gradually towards systems integraton.. Now is a great time to start puting these broken pieces back together. </span>Given these limitations there are bound to be errors in a project like this. The model has now survived several peer reviews, breaking attemps by rival theorists and scrutiny at a high level neuroscience conference. Most of the suriving facets of the dipole neurology project have been through several iterations with years of reflection between them. That is the project had been dropped and taken up with nothing more than the approach, well lets see what still stands. Even with such a throwaway consideration it still seems like the model can unravel hidden  secrets of neurodevelopment, provide a new model for current mysteries in neuroscience, and finally give a new map of the whole brain at a physics / structural level.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"><strong>PREDICTED PROBLEMS WITH THIS APPROACH</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68">  I would like to make things easier for anyone reading this, so provide easy version videos and tutorials, and feel i should  answer the following problems.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"><strong>1. The dipole approach bypasses the reality of the brains complexity.</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68">As mentioned above one reason medical science is unable to, or  having difficulty in recognising this approach is t<span class="style16">hat the brain is  microscopically complex, and the majority of our knowledge in neurosciences is concentrated in gaining understanding of the brain in fragments within it's full complexity. Although this models   override this complexity and miss out non mammilian brain parts, like the, hypothalamus and spinal cord</span>, in comparison to other models for the brain, it's quite realistic for going at a very large scope as, the dipole models include the vast majority of the skulls newly developed content. White matter, grey matter, neurons, receptors, ventricles, all cortical and limbic structures. However the model is still abstract and oversimplified and will be some time before the project finally gets to the level of fitting completely with whats known of  brain complexity</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"><strong>2. A &quot;so what&quot; reaction..where would it get us anyway ?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"> Initially i would have agreed. It took quite a bit of persistance to complete the model by approaching the wierd shaped limbic system, and trying to understand how the brain works as an interaction between the limbic and cortical systems. Only after completion, I was able to say, that this approach could be giving a powerfull explanatory approach to  neurodevelopment and perhaps the evolution of the whole brain system all the way back to the development of symmetrical nervous systems about 700,000,000 years ago. Not what i expected when i started on this project at all.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"><strong>3. A &quot;can't prove that even if were true&quot; reaction. It's too complex a model to falsify</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68"><span class="style16">The result of sidelining this approach of investigating larger structures in their electromagnetic context, is that the brain has been broken apart into many thousands of pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, and we have managed to put a fraction of the pieces back together. This theory attempts to give an intrinsic  understanding of the brain structure, functions and abnormalities, by putting all of the pieces back together and  looking at the whole brain as a  system. </span> If this is something which cannot be falsified then we should really be looking at whether falsification works for complex systems.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style68">I approach this question here <a href="Theory Introduction-the importance-of-systems-theory.html"><strong>&ldquo;The importance of systems theory in this project&rdquo;</strong></a></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63 style65"><img src="images/leonardo.jpg" width="575" height="283"></p>
              <p align="center">LEFT : Leonardo Da Vinci, made  contributions to neurophysiology by taking a creative approach based on  simplicity, vision and experience.&nbsp; RIGHT  : Descartes sought to decipher the brain by it&rsquo;s symmetry. Back then they didnt know about dipole and quadrapole structures, and since then these kind of whole system visual approaches have been discarded.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15"> ABOUT THIS SITES TECHNICAL LEVEL</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">I have  tried to make this site as easy to understand as possible, hopefully enough  that an interested layperson can grab the concept, from the videos and  tutorials. For more information on whats in the site click <a href="../__Pages/Site Map.html">&quot;<strong>site map</strong>&quot;</a> in the menu bars.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">&quot;Dipole  Neurology&quot; is probably one of the most extreme simplifications of complex  Neuroscience availiable. The test of whether there is truth in this  simplification is to expose it to all the brain's complexity, and see if the  dipole approach can present a strong case that it does simplify or answer increasing amounts of questions about the complex  brain.&nbsp; That requires that I take  the pieces of the neuroscience puzzle and see how easily they fit into the dipole framework.. Unfortunately that can get pretty complicated, so following this work at times needs higher school level grasp of systems theory and physics, with a degree level understanding of neuroscience, chemistry and biology. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15">FEEDBACK AND ME GETTING IT WRONG</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">My challenge to critics is that you falsify the theory, by presenting a satisfactory non dipole model that can equally simplify the phenomena I provide evidence for. That is give a non-electromagnetic explanation for how brain structure ends up looking so much like multipole structures. Especially the cortex, and how all cortical features appear to be so magnetic in origin. Currently no scientist and critic of this approach has been able to explain this away. However it will be some time till ethical methods can be devised to test this theory. The mechanism proposed for magnetic formation of the cortex for example is ion flow through the connexins of the radial glial scaffolding, that are only present in the developing brain.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The project will be a <a href="../__Pages/Creative Commons.html"><strong>creative commons project</strong></a>. in the style of the emerging  research climate which tends towards open collaborations. Contributors to the project are going to have a seperate page made for them soon.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">However so we are not wasting our time and patience, I would ask :</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">1.  That you understand the central ideas well at a technical level. <em>(If i do not communicate this well, please let me know)</em></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><br>
                2. Have  at least read a summary of the evidence in the sections <span class="style67"><a href="../2. Theory Background/Theory Background.html">&quot;The theory&quot; </a></span>and understood what the evidence i present is trying to say.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">I hope you find this subject and the research as interesting as i did. If you are interested and having problems  understanding, please <a href="../__Pages/Contact.html"><span class="style67">contact </span></a>me. From this feedback i will get an idea what to  revise, and what to put on the FAQ page. If you have smaller suggestions or feedback post at the blog. Details for those are in the bars above and below.</p>
