              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>SECTION ABSTRACT</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>Here we look at harder evidence for the  idea that the entire brains content must be consistent with an electric dipole  structure. Neurotransmitters,&nbsp; receptors,  ions, neuromodulators and lipids,</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>First I tackle the cortex primary  grey matter, Gaba and glutamate. I describe their ratios, function and systems  properties within the cortex. I then set out on a a meta-analysis of existing  information to prove that the glutamate system is lateralized in the Right  Cerebral hemisphere (RCH) and Gaba system is lateralized in the Left Cerebral  Hemisphere (LCH). This includes their enzyme and lipid process also. </strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>Also from further analysis it is  revealed that&nbsp; NMDA receptors are  strongly lateralized to the right temporal lobe, and GabaA receptors to the  left temporal lobe. As temporal lobes have highest grey matter density it is  proposed that the temporal lobes represent the cortex dipole&rsquo;s poles as they contain  the greatest separation of charges in the brain on many levels :</strong></p>

              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>Following this a meta-analysis of  secondary cortical content, neuromodulators, dopamine, serotonin and related  chemical groups.

              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>I then make the point that both Gaba  and dopamine are not only RCH lateralized but also tend towards acidic  processes while Glutamate and Serotonin are not only LCH lateralized but also  tend towards base processes.&nbsp; The acid / base  lateralized systems for both primary neurotransmitters and neuromodulators  exist in an axis (as one increases in the brain the other decreases and vice  versa)</strong></p>

              <p align="justify" class="style112">REVERSE CHARGE POLARITY  AT THE BRAINS POLES</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style103">THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE TWO PAPERS : TENSEGRITY SYSTEM WITHIN NEURON CHEMISTRY AND NEUROCHEMICAL MODULATORS</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The poles of a dipole, electric or magnetic have polarity. Since  the brain structure is mostly electrical it has to be presumed that we are  looking mainly for electric polarity. Positive and Negative or it's counterpart in complex physiology which could be defining these poles in many other ways : Acid/base, Hyper/depolarized etc. As long as we have a seperation of charges, and these converge/diverge towards specific points, which are at opposite ends of the brain. In the previous section i looked at the upper temporal lobes as not only the points of greatest brain assymetry in the neuropsycholigical systems terms to define a dipole, but also structurally in that they lay between the toroidal cavity/ bloch wall and correlated with dipole branching of field lines.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The purpose of this section is to provide proofs in the language of neuroscience. Reviews of the availible scientific  literature on the brains small scale content : neurotransmitters, receptors and  neurochemical distributions, finds a wealth of evidence describing  cross hemisphere reversals of brain content, which assist  in line with the charge requirements of the dipole model. Something like this (below)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="../1. Theory introduction/images/gabaglut-3.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="287"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">This subject has been tackled in two papers  LINK. The first which attempt to show that the distribution of primary ionic  excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters Gaba and Glutumate, their voltage  gated receptors and ions, have a reverse symmetry (they resemble each other in  an opposite manner&hellip;see diagram above) The results lateralised in line with a  dipole model and the systems theory definitions of their expected properties (convergent left hemisphere, divergent right hemisphere). At the temporal lobes or poles, the Glutamate   AMPA/KAINATE sodium firing receptors were found to be lateralized at the right poles with the GABAA / GABAC chlorine firing receptors at the left pole. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">Before jumping into the long and technical proofs, it should be borne in mind that what is being looked for is a separtion of charges at the brains poles which could arise in development before neurons become active. The primary ions involved in left  / right brain lateralization are negatively charged chlorine and positively  charged sodium. I will show that<strong> Gaba is lateralized to  the left hemisphere and Glutamate in the right hemisphere, more so at the  temporal regions. </strong>Gaba forms mainly convergent neuron networks and fires  negatively charged chlorine ions which inhibit neurons.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Glutamate forms mainly Divergent neuron  networks.and fires positively charged sodium ions which excite neurons. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">In systems theory terms this choiced of ions nature has selected looks extremely hopefull for a system of opposite charges.. NaCl itself as a salt crystal is known to have a tensegrity structure, which means that in systems terms sodium and chlorine exert an equal amount of push and pull towards each other. This is interchangablly known as convergence/ divergence. It fits on many levels. Systems theory definitions of convergent / divergent describe dipole poles, as well as the interaction of NaCl, which one of the ideal elements if you were to set about building a biological based seperation of charges</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="../1. Theory introduction/images/nacl-tensegrity.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="245"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style113">Tensegrity patterns within sodium  chloride crystal, taken from visualizations of&nbsp;  Madelung constant (174) (<strong><em>The energy of a particular crystal structure  relative to the same number of isolated molecules ) </em></strong>&nbsp;A symmetry of constant and repeating quantities appear to recurse for both interactions with attraction and  repulsion. Looking at the patterns from the NaCl  lattice. For equal values of R, the number of constant connections remains 6  throughout any scale.&nbsp; That is they appear if  beginning outwards from Sodium or chlorine in the centre, while working outward  through the increasing connective radius.&nbsp;   This cubic kind of charge opposite symmetrical  tension and integrity exists for NaCl as a crystal and only a handful of other  organic element combinations.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15">EXAMINING THE CORTEX PRIMARY NEUROCHEMICAL CONTENT</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The ratio of cortical glutamate to gaba  neurons is approx 25/75. (74) &nbsp;This  unequal ratio of number, does not represent the ratio of inhibitory/excitation in  the brain. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>1.</strong> GABA  has a higher fidelity of information transmittal than that of other known major  neurotransmitters, (22a) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>2.</strong> The  numbers of dopamine neurons and pathways in the brain, is small compared to the  number of serotonin neurons, yet they still compete equally for chemical  resources and brain territory, with dopamine controlling the left hemisphere  and serotonin the right. (REF) Adding serotonin decreases the formation of  dopamine and vice versa. (128) (mod paper) Gaba and Glutamate also exist on such  an axis : Acidification decreases postsynaptic efficacy of glutamate, and alkalinization  increases it while &nbsp;alkalinization &nbsp;decreases GABAergic inhibitory function and acidification  decreases it. (22a)  The point is that i would predict the GABA/NMDA system exists in some kind of balance, even if how they express themselves in bare numbers of components does not appear balanced. The cortex does tend towards excitatory processes, but this need not rely on Glutamate. Gaba neurons can also exert disinhibtion <br>
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>3</strong>. The ratio of cortical gaba synapses is estimated at  40%. (352,353) . They can exert a lot of control with a minority  numbers of  synapses.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style113"><em>&ldquo;The  ubiquity and extent of immunocytochemically visualized presynaptic endings of  inhibitory GABAergic neurons on various structures in the vertebrate nervous  system are striking. The impression is that of looking at a highly restrained  nervous system&hellip;. This is accomplished largely by the  disinhibition of pacemaker neurons whose activities are under the dual tonic  inhibitory controls of local-circuit GABAergic neurons and of GABAergic  projection neurons coming from neural command centers.. &hellip;.cortical  and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are literally studded with terminals from  inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Not only are the endings of the local-circuit  GABAergic aspinous stellate neurons densely distributed around the somata and  dendrites of the cortical pyramidal cells, but they are also located on initial  axon segments, where they act as frequency filters&rdquo;(22a)</em></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>4</strong>. Cortical chaos is also tamed  by sensory thalamic input, (75)&nbsp; The  thalamus is entirely coated with G-protein GabaB inhibitory receptors. (76)&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>5.</strong> Glutamate  receptors are highly diverse. Glutamate is more likely to form divergent  network. The same transmitter can activate many kinds of receptors and  responses.&nbsp;Gaba receptors are mostly homogenous. Gaba has  a diverse number of transmitters directed at a single chloride channel. <em>(see diagram below)</em> Convergent networks  activate many types of response from a single source, and need smaller numbers  of components to match a divergent network. (REF)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="images/receptors.jpg" width="575" height="549"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><span class="style113"><strong>Top graphic :</strong> Gaba receptors are heterogenous and can be targetted by many neurochemicals. They will naturally tend towards convergent networks. <strong>Bottom Graphic :</strong> Glutamate receptors proliferate in type but have one trigger. They will tend to form divergent networks.</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">In  mind of the last point above, the cortical dipole proposal in the previous  section points out that in comparison to each other, the left hemisphere is a  convergent system and the right hemisphere a divergent one. &nbsp;It is no surprise that the inhibitory Gaba receptors are lateralized in the left hemisphere. (24,25,26).&nbsp; However something that has come up in this  research is that other researchers have a harder time pinpointing cortical distributions  of right hemisphere excitatory Glutamate, or Serotonin receptors in comparison  to their left hemisphere inhibitory counterparts Gaba or dopamine. (REFS)  Divergent networks are harder to pin down due to their heterogeneous  proliferations. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">This gives  me quite a task. I have to prove that not only is Gaba left lateralized, and  Glutamate right lateralized but for a dipole that there will be more Gaba at  the brains left pole, and more Glutamate at the right pole.&nbsp; Luckily for this project, there was such an  intense amount of research in lateralization from 1970 to 1990, that there is a  wealth of papers describing lateralization&rsquo;s, for most major component&rsquo;s in the  brain.&nbsp; I might have seem to have overdone  it on the proof&rsquo;s here, but there will be mistakes and problems, so if two out  of six are ok,&nbsp; I probably still have some  kind of case.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style74">Glutamate  treatment of the LCH (Left Cerebral Hemisphere) has marked excitatory effect  (increase in aggression) and retarding sensory processing effect because there  is little transcallosal inhibition from the RCH (Right Cerebral Hemisphere) Glutamate  treatment of the RCH has no effect because there is transcallosal inhibition  from the LCH Glutamate treatment of both LCH and RCH retards both hemispheres  sensory processing but with no LCH increase in aggression. RCH is retarded  because LCH inhibition is affected by glutamate treatment, while LCH is less  extremely affected as there is still some degree of transcallosal inhibition  from the RCH. This tells us is the LCH is not as equipped to handle the same  glutamate levels as the RCH as there is little inhibition coming from the RCH.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="images/Research applications_clip_image005.jpg" width="532" height="414"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">As was shown Schizoprenia laterality can be linked to imbalances of lipids associated with either brain hemisphere. Schizophrenia  which is now considered to be a dysfunction&nbsp; of dysregulated   N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptors operating at reduced activity. &nbsp;(78, 81,602a). The enzyme that degrades the  NMDA receptor antagonist N-acetyl-alpha L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG), is in  the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and temporal cortex of patients with  schizophrenia.. (82<strong>) </strong>Grey  matter loss is not symmetrical between hemispheres and does not correlate with  areas of highest grey matter density as it does in alzheimers. Grey matter loss  does correlate with veinous return system which is symmetrically distributed <em>(left in image above, veins are blue)</em>.  </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">However even though the grey  matter loss correlates with a symmetrical system of the brain, the disease  progresses slightly asymmetrically in top parietal right hemisphere. Two years  later (image above) grey matter loss becomes symmetrical in parietal then  extremely assymetrical in right temporal, when rates of temporal loss start to correlate  with the onset of positive symptoms (602b,80)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">As neuron density is equal amongst  hemispheres and even slightly greater in the left temporal lobe (351) it&rsquo;s  proposed that these asymmetrical&nbsp; patterns  of loss especially at the temporal lobes, represent a more extremely lateralized  distribution of NMDA to GABA receptors in the cortex proposed dipole poles. &nbsp;There  is left hemisphere asymmetry of Gaba receptors and neurons in left auditory  cortex (440b) While Reduction of  Gaba concentration in the left temporal pole but not the right is correlated  with extreme anxiety. (400c) Implying that Gaba loss in the left temporal lobe has worse consequences than Gaba loss at the right temporal lobe. What you would expect if the left temporal lobe operates its functions more greatly on Gaba. Gaba loss at the left but not right temporal lobe is also correlated with a move to secondary symptomns of schizoprhenia.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">There is  a slightly decreased dysfunction of GABA receptors in the left  hippocampus as schizophrenia moves towards first positive sympoms. (402) This is because NMDA-mediated  glutamatergic activity impinges on GABA interneurons(604) NMDA-mediated GABA  release is&nbsp; markedly decreased.  (604)&nbsp; However this is a sub symptom of  NMDA hypofunction (82) resulting in disinhibition that impairs  cortical-hippocampal processing (82) Only a specific minority of Gaba neurons  are affected (605,606,608) &nbsp;&nbsp;This asymmetrical NMDA hypofunction induced  damage to Gaba function in the left hippocampus highlights that there is an asymmetrical  distribution of GabaA receptors in the left hippocampus. GabaA receptors are  globally heterogeneous, so if they exist equally in the right hippocampus it  would be expected that there would no dysfunctional asymmetry. &nbsp;To summarize, the above strongly suggest that  GabaA receptors are strongly leftwards lateralized to the brain&rsquo;s proposed  poles, the Hippocampal, temporal, auditory areas.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">As for glutamate, as was shown in  the section above <em>&ldquo;INHIBITION OF AA, PLA2 AND PGE2&nbsp; IN LCH BY GABA  AND OMEGA 3&rdquo;</em> &nbsp;PLA2 activity is elevated in the RCH. Left  brain asymmetry in Patients with schizophrenia was shifted back to balanced  left/right processing following treatment with omega 3 eicosapentaenoic acid.&nbsp; (759c) &nbsp;which reduces PLA2 activity (609a) For the purpose of a dipole model PLA2  activity which is lateralized both to RCH and glutamate LTP was<strong> increased by 45% in the temporal cortex of  patients with schizophrenia but was not significantly altered in other brain  areas</strong> (602c) &nbsp;This would have been rebalancing of the brain dipoles right temporal cortex. That area accords with the dark red temporal areas seen in  the UCLA images above.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="images/Research applications_clip_image003.jpg" width="575" height="307"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">While the above section points out there is an asymmetry of primary NMDA and GABAA receptors at the brains temporal poles, the above diagram shows that these are also the areas with the highest neuron densities. In alzheimers the brain areas affected first are those of highest neuron density. <span class="style74">The temporal lobes could then be said to contain the brains greatest seperation of positive and negative charges.</span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style15">SUMMARY OF THE ABOVE SIX SECTIONS:</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15">The brain has a greater degree of excitatory NMDA related function in the right than the left hemisphere, and GABA related function in the left. This applies to many of it's related lipid and enyme processes. At the left and right temporal poles there is a greater degree of Asymmetry between GABA and NMDA respectively, These areas contain the brains highest seperation of the negative (CL-)and positive (NA+) charges active at any time in the processes of Hyper and Depolarization respectively. Not suprisingly similiar lateralization patterns also appear to be emerging for enzyme, modulation and lipid processes associated with the brains primary grey matter content.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style15">Medical databases contain a wealth of data to illustrate that entire chemical groups and their primary subtypes like Dopamine can be grouped with Gaba in the LCH and Serotonin with Glutamate in the RCH. All of these exist on a LCH acid, RCH base axis system. LCH neurochemicals and receptors have convergent homogenous properties while RCH neurochemcals and receptors have divergent heterogenous properties.  </p>
              <p align="left" class="style103"><strong>FREQUENCY REDUCTION AND ACID/BASE CHANGES TOWARDS THE POLES</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"> The above indicates a complete dipole model of brain content can be put together based on neurochemical acid/base properties. <span class="style128">As there is a greater concentration of Gaba and NMDA receptors at the brain's pole the ionic gradients will tend to be  more acidic at the left pole, and alkaline at the right pole.</span> The dipole seperation of charges can now be based on several levels. Polar Seperation of Postive and negative ions used in neurotransmission (Na+, Cl-). Polar seperation of acid/ base reactions and polar seperation of Hyper/depolarizing proceses.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The Acid/Base seperation at poles, will be represented in  a visual diagram below. While constructung such a complete cortical dipole model  it is also important to show that in electric dipole as two charges move apart from the midline and distance increases (CHECK) their wavelength and wave energy decreases. In a similiar way that the Dipole was able to simplify small scale brain content, This frequency reduction aspect could have ramifications for the entire distribution of neural processing</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The brain is proposed to be an  electric dipole defined primarily by the seperation of its charges at the temporal regions. Each ionotropic neuron  synapse in the cortical layer is isolated as a series of point like charges into neuron assemblies connected by axons to its opposite  charge counterpart across hemispheres. <em>(this is a simplification of brain wiring of  course</em>). At the midline of this seperation the corpus callosum, we find that the brain processes visual sensory information, which has high electromagnetic frequency. Moving out from the midline the receptive fields which process vision increase with size to process larger aspects of visual information with lower frequency information. Moving out further to the auditory cortex at the temporal lobes, the eletromagnetic frequency for sensory input dips sharply to 20,000 hz., This higher frequency auditory information is processed first then moving out further decreases in steps  to just 15hz.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style63">This diagram shows the processing  of high to low frequency information (visual to auditory) is spread across the  brain consistent with the slowing of frequency distribution towards the pole of  a dipole. At a dipole midline (In the diagram above the central disc represents  the dipole midline.) electromagnetic energy is at it's highest frequency and  then slows towards the poles. The visual system mirrors complex processing of  high frequency information.&nbsp; (3,4 in fig  above)&nbsp; in either side.&nbsp;&nbsp; As processing moves out from the midline to  the  auditory regions (where the arrow emerges as well as 2 in figure  above)&nbsp; Lower frequency information is  being processed with higher degrees of polarization. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63"><span class="style71">Moving forward in the brain the distribution of high to low frequency from midline out repeats. The motor strip deals with feet, then further out higher up the body finally at the face. The fastest processing is needed for flight and fight reactions, while the slower processing for communication. Again forward to the frontal lobes, the midline shunts up fast reacting emotional,spatial and memory data while moving out from the midline motor processing occurs, and in farthest regions the slower requirements of speech and social interaction.</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>TORQUE AND POLARITY ARE BOTH FEATURES OF DIPOLES</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">Electric dipoles undergo torque or precession, which means they spin at an angle within a magnetic field. Remeber the brain model proposed is of a bioelectric dipole coated by a magnetite/ <em>f</em>errihydrite/ lipid ferrofluid, so some torque is feasible. Brains  have two known torque structures formed in childhood known. One is known as Yakovlevian torque. It is as if the entire brain is trying to twist round on itself. Another  is called volume torque, which looks like temporal lobe is leading one side from the other. The dipole model proposes answers for both.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><img src="images/torque.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="402"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The cortical ferrofluid develops magnetic field coherence when blood deoxygenates and neurons fire their electromagnetic field to it. Under those conditions there is a theoretical explanation for whole brain Yakovlevian torque due to precession within the brain regions that bind together. In an adult this isn't known of. Regions bind together but not the entire brain. In neurodevelopment the brain structures changes through extremes, where there is abundance of bias towards the white connective matter, which is prominent in brain binding.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The brain dipole model also proposes that two opposite kinds of charge are present at either temporal lobe. Negative at the left and positive at the right, due to the ions Cl- and Na+ which predominate in either sides primary ionic receptors. Is volume torque near the temporal lobes, the result of opposite forces of charge due to ions ?&nbsp; In schizophrenia volume torque increases.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><span class="style113"><em>&ldquo; volume torque was  changed in schizophrenia-in comparison subjects<strong>, </strong>the coronal section of maximal left hemisphere volume was more  anteriorly placed than on the right [and correlated with left superior temporal  gyrus (STG) volume], and, in patients, it was more posterior (showing a  reversed correlation with left STG volume).&rdquo;</em>(20)</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"> In schizophrenia the glutamate / sodium part  of the dipole in the right temporal lobe breaks down faster than the left temporal lobe. <em>(&nbsp;Red in diagram above.)</em> The increased&nbsp;leftward asymmetry in schizophrenia can also be read from the ionic field itself in EEG. The interplay between  hemispheres is increased in favour of the left hemisphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Cortical features such as sulci  patterns are different even in identical twins, suggesting that they would be  plastic to the forces suggested here. These patterns may occur due to magnetic precession at  the brain surface, and grow differently due to the unique interactions, even twins will have with the environment.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The Dipole theory predicts a  separation of opposite charges at the brains poles, the temporal areas. It also  predicts that the entire cortex small scale content, neurons,  neurotransmitters, lipid&rsquo;s, receptors, enzymes and chemical groups are  lateralized, in a manner consistent with the overall convergent/divergent  processes of the left and right cortical hemispheres respectively.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74"><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">If the cortical dipole model  is true, Meta analysing the thousands of papers on lateralization  should reveal whether the brain&rsquo;s small scale content is lateralized consistent  with the features of the dipole model.</p>

                The basic ions of the  primary neurotransmitters receptors (Sodium for Glutamate and Chlorine for  Gaba) have properties of opposing balance which fit will with systems theory  requirements for convergence / divergence, and field reversals for each side of  the system with opposing charge properties.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style74">The ratio of Gaba to  Glutamate neurons is in favour of glutamate 27.5 / 72.5&nbsp; and do not fit a basic 50/50 balance which  would have been sought for a dipole model. However convergent aspects of a  system require less firing components, and more control components. The ratio  of Gaba to NMDA synapses is 40/60. Because Gaba receptors are homogenous they also  attract other types of inhibitory neurotransmitter systems to work for them. An  increase in systems power which does not belong to the Glutamate receptors. &nbsp;&nbsp;Glutamate  receptors are heterogeneous. They tend towards proliferating many types of  connections explaining why there is a higher ratio of neurons.</p>
