              <p align="justify" class="style89">DOES DIPOLE SOLVE  BINDING COMPUTATION PROBLEM ?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style93">The Ferrofluid outlined in section 4 is ideal for  short term quantum &quot;style&quot; superposition processing at body temperatures.&nbsp;  I investigate neurophysiology of EEG, P300 and the computations of the thalamocortical system in order to understand if corticolimbic brain processes occur  in cycles of cortical superposition and thalamic spectral decomposition.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>FERROFLUIDS SOLUTION TO CONSCIOUS BINDING AND SHORT TERM MEMORY</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">One of the biggest problems for neuroscience is that neuron  assemblies do not explain how new sensory stimuli entering the brain, can be  held together in mind and decided upon and decisions made as to which area of  the neural assembly to hold them.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&ldquo;Imagine a group of neurons, a neural  assembly or ensemble, to represent a feature. Suppose we have 4 of such,  denoted as A, B, C, and D. Now you are in a situation where the representation  of a complicated situation where all 4 of them needs to be activated, such as  recognition of a blue (represented by A) monster (B), and a red (C) lobster  (D). If each feature is represented by merely activating the corresponding  ensemble, it would not be able to distinguish the situation against &quot;red  monster and blue lobster&quot;. This is the so called superposition catastrophe  and is a big part of the binding problem. (Malsburg) (428)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Then another problem is where this information is hold for  longer than the period of initial perception.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>As soon as local fields are generated, the  brain uses another mechanism to integrate local patterns into a global pattern  of activity.. During this period of sustained activity they possibly interact  with other local fields, spatially distributed in the brain, to generate the  content of a conscious perceptual episode&hellip;..</strong> This result is consistent with  the role of gamma synchronous oscillations in conscious perception &hellip; conscious  episodes composing the &ldquo;conscious present&rdquo; can be extended to periods of 2 or 3  seconds (P&ouml;ppel,1994)&hellip;..the minimum latency time for conscious processing would  be around 200 ms. Therefore<strong>, the  sustaining of neuronal activity necessary to support conscious processing would  range from 200 ms to 2/3 seconds.  How does the brain achieve this result</strong>? (296)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Cortical  Ferrofluids are capable of answering the binding problem of superposition and  the missing parts in understanding short term memory. Ferrofluids have the property  of being able to sustain wave superposition (420) while the spin glass  frustration has the structure to hold multiple layers of memory at once over a  longer period of time.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style16">SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE : When  two or more wave moving through the same region of space, waves will  superimpose and produce a well defined combined effect. Wave maintain their  integrity upon overlapping (without themselves being permanently changed).</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63">Nunez a respected neuroscientist in eeg has  proposed that the cortex can best be understood in terms of wave like activity at the brain surface,  inducing standing waves, which will propogate across the surface (330) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&quot;The eigenfunctions for waves on the surface of a sphere are also of interest in the application of wavelike ideas to EEG. Of course the &quot;hemispheres&quot; of the brain are not spheres. Each hemisphere can perhaps be pictures as a bumpy football with a hole in the bottom for a brainstem. ...We consider waves travelling through the cortex(including the association fibres) with possible relay through the thalamus. Since the cortex is closed upon itself the analogy to spherical geometry will be quite usefull at least in a qualitative sense...The eigeinfunctions for waves (nondispersive and undamped) are given by functions called the &quot;spherical harmonics&quot;These eigenfunctions..are the spatial shapes of the normal modes for the waves on the surface of a sphere. Waves on the sphere do not reflect off boundaries..Here waves travelling in one direction will go round the sphere and coalesce with other waves. (700 p 330)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>REINTERPRATING EEG</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The GAMMA  oscillations, <em>(which are unique to the cortex)</em> involved in activating  the binding of perceived sensory input to short term memory would provide an AC signal to write ferrofluid signal. The idea of carrier signals in neurology is prevailent with several different versions existing. (426a, 566, 426) While slower waves delta to alpha would probably be carriers for limbic / cortical interactions, requring multiplexing of information, Where as Beta is marked out as an ideal long distance cortico/cortical carrier (424v3).</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&ldquo;Recordings of EEG activity in animals  and humans demonstrate the spatial coherence of oscillations carrying  spatiotemporal patterns, as described by Freeman in Chapter 2. The recordings  reveal a shared oscillation in cortical potential over extended cortical areas  within the beta <strong>band (12 Hz to 30 Hz) </strong>and gamma band (30 Hz to 80 Hz). <strong>These fluctuations serve as a carrier wave  for perception information by means of spatial patterns with amplitude  modulation (AM)&rdquo;</strong> (566)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/ferrofluid-4.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="403"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Whatever the carrier signal  is the diagram above  summarizes the theory. The analogy is much like a tape loop recorder, except  the flow of blood moves the ferrofluid layer. &nbsp;Those signals which garner the requirements to  register as short term memory by being gamma associated neural activity, get written to the ferrofluid layer, as ferroelectric fluids respond to AC phase.  Singal amplification is increased by the hemodynamic response and supported by ab eletromagnetic carrier proved by  (depending on cortical areas involved) 
                alpha/theta/beta synchrony. BOLD fMRI correlates both ERP (411) and Event oscillation  (409) T</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">As well as providing, large area superpositional binding, The role of the ferromagnetic material in consciousness is being proposed  as a buffer or cache between short term processing and medium to long term  memory processes. While neurons are firing, creating ionic changes in the  extracellular fluid.&nbsp; This buffer grabs  and holds Modulated Evoked signals associated with short term memory.&nbsp; These would be split into two types event  related potentials ERP (405) which will be explained more fully, and Event related oscillation ERO signals such as delta to gamma (407). The ERO signals in the various combinations outlined, would be equivalent to bias and carrier signal applied  to a recording tape. No data could be found that ferroelectric fluids at physiological tempratures can do more than record information one way, so the fluid layer may just be for sustaining superpositioned information in a fast acting short term binding layer.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>FEASIBILITY OF MACROSCOPIC QUANTUM  &quot;STYLE&quot; COMPUTATION WITHIN THE FERROFLUID</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">This writing of perceived information  by gamma oscillations to conscious perception is followed by a unique signal  called P300, called so because it occurs about 300 milliseconds after conscious  perception. (408a) &nbsp;The P300 generation is entirely cortical, covering much of it&rsquo;s area (402,403)  and involved in a wide range of perceptual selection processes such as object  recognition. (<strong>408a2) </strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Stimulus encoding that promotes successful memory storage to  facilitate retrieval and recognition produces increased P300-like amplitude  (402) It&rsquo;s intrinsic  functionality in dealing with many probable outcomes ,marks it out as a signal  which could be involved in superposition calculation. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&ldquo;the P300 is not distinct from, but neither entirely  explained by, the background dynamics of neural activity. It is not singularly  caused by the resetting of pre-existing oscillatory activity, but rather it is  affected by and affects such activity. Both explanations fit with the leading  explanation for gross P300 behavior, the context updating hypothesis. <strong>The P300 is thought in this model to  represent the physical change undergone when probabilities tied to certain outcomes  are refreshed in light of the subject&rsquo;s most recent contextual information</strong>&rdquo;(403) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/p300.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="300"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Images of P300 activation during perceptul processing. P300 consists of two signals, P3a/P3b with P3a being more anterior.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">P300 and similar signals are entirely cortical even through  they consist of phase locking theta / delta oscillations originating from the  limbic system. (402, 576, 576a, b).&nbsp;&nbsp; I  am going to suggest that the P300 signal represents the calculation of a superposition  process, firstly because it appears to mark the processing of cortical  superpositions.&nbsp; Evoked signals from  sensory input propagate throughout the cortex and add up in a superposition of  gamma activity (411c)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><br>
                Because  the P300 is a synchronized composite signal, other researchers (weiss below) have correlated  the P300 spectra and individuals memory span number with the number of layers  in a quantum spectra. (426) A quantum spectra is a superposition of waveforms,  which could equivocate well, to a proposed function of the P300, to collapse  cortical wave superposition. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style86">&ldquo;The number of EEG harmonics (n = 1, 2,  ... , 9) is identical with memory span, and the eigenvalues of the EEG impulse  response are represented by the zero-crossings up to the convolved fundamental,  the P300. In analogy to quantum mechanics the brain seems to be an ideal  detector simply measuring the energy of wave forms. No matter what the stimulus  is and how the brain behaves, the metric of signal and memory can always be  understood as a superposition of np states of different energy and their  eigenvalues&hellip; Vichnevetsky discovered (1988) by simulation experiments  &quot;unexpectedly that wave propagation in computational fluid dynamics and  the motion of particles in quantum mechanics share similar mathematics&rdquo; &hellip;&hellip;.. &ldquo;According to the  Wentzel-Brillouin-Kramers (WBK) method of quantum mechanics (Wentzel 1926), the  number of zero-crossings (Fig. 2) is identical with the quantum number. From  this follows: The number of zero-crossings of an evoked potential up to the  P300 is identical with memory span (i.e. with the number of macroscopic ordered  states)&rdquo;.(426) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/weiss.jpg" alt="1" width="575" height="376"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><span class="style74">The two sets  of waveforms on the left&nbsp; represent the  P300 of a low and high IQ group. Notice the high IQ group has more complex  waveforms. Each of these waveforms has been calculated as a spectra of  harmonics which correlate with the number of items held in short term memory</span>. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Weiss correlated the P300 components  as harmonics and a quantum spectra.&nbsp; An individuals  memory span number with the number of nodes in a quantum spectra. (426) &nbsp;&nbsp;A quantum spectra is a superposition of  harmonically related waveforms. Harmonics arise in electrical systems where Alternating Currents are transformed into direct currents resulting in direct current power increases. (425a3) Walter freeman describes how neuromodulators can be modelled on such processes (425a4) . There is a body of work by different researchers which indicated that harmonic structures exist in EEG (425b3)  are linked to memory capacity (425b2,426, 425c) and intrinsic mathematically to chaotic systems. (425d)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Weiss contributes especially in this area by showing that the higher harmonics which correlate to the <span class="style85">smallest time window of conscious information  processing </span>exist only with higher IQ which is also correlated with increased memory span. (426, 425e,425f) Weiss also promotes the idea that the brain can be understood better in terms of spectral decomposition.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style87"><span class="style78">&quot;high IQ subjects exhibit a greater complexity of EEG  follows from the quantum number increase for the wave function with the result  of higher brain power for Fourier transformation of information&quot;.</span> (425e)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">To summarise Volkmar Weiss . Each component of the spectra leading up to  P300 is a harmonic representation of evoked potential in the gamma range (576c)  . each node within the wave can be associated with a unique phase  (426b,d). Recent research finds that the Storage of 7 +/- 2 short-term memories  would be gamma evoked potentials multiplexed in subcycles on carrier waves slow  delta to alpha which define memory span (426a)&nbsp;So several things are in place for a Quantum  &ldquo;style&rdquo; computation. Many superpositioned signals  each with it&rsquo;s own phase  space. What is required for the other side of the quantum &ldquo;style&rdquo; equation is  spectral measurement.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style87"><em><strong>&quot;the brain seems to be an ideal detector simply measuring the energy of wave forms.
