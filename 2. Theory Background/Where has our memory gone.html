              <p align="justify" class="style15"><span class="style16">Researchers in various fields have still not found where  human short term memory is stored.&nbsp; In  this section I present evidence and concepts which illustrate that our brain is  impregnated with the components for a ferroelectric fluid capable of holding memories in layers. Ferrofluid gives missing pieces, and unifies many current theories of brain function. Neurodynamics, Stochastic  resonance, CEMI field, NAAMF&rsquo;s (Neuronal activity associated magnetic fields)</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style15"><strong>WHERE IS CONSCIOUSNESS AND  SHORT TERM MEMORY ?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The differing  branches of debate, study and lab research tracking where consciousness lies  has gradually emerged to the brain surface. Quantum gap junction theory  (Hameroff,), and mainstream Neuron based neuroscience both at very different  camps, have reached an impasse. Their results have lead them to the cortical  brain surface where astrocytes couple together. Yet the low speed and lack of  information density at the surface, still do not provide &nbsp;them with sought after answers. The brain  surface is also where Banaclocha (125 ) and MacFadden (352), provide more direct connections to this &ldquo;<em>dipole  neurology</em>&rdquo; project. Both of these predict memory is held in different  aspects of the electromagnetic field at the brain surface.&nbsp; Banaclocha (397) has published several papers proposing that  there is magnetic recording occurring at the cortex and was the first to publish the concept of this substance playing a role in cortical function.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Banaclocha states the problem </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><span class="style63"><em>&quot;human memory processes, like contextual recall, work  at such high speed and integrate such a large number of cortical neurons and  neuronal networks that molecular mechanisms of information storage and synaptic  transmission seem insufficient. </em>&quot;</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">He then takes MacFadden's cortical surface work further by proposing </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">&quot;any type of information can be stored in the form of  &lsquo;neuronal activity-associated magnetic fields' that would record information in  much the same way as the magnetic tape of a tape recorder&quot; (397)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">These magnetic interactions would be reciprocal magnetic interaction between neurones  and astrocytes. He points to the existence of astroglial magnetic fields and astroglial induction  of neuronal firing. (398)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The electrical coupling between astrocytes play a role in the synchronization of ripples, high gamma oscillations (5751) which may &quot;alarm&quot; the brain  about network large firing neurons. (424v) These would be similiar to hameroff  &quot;hyper neurons&quot; however he admits that even these cannot account for cortical binding.(574a)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">For this project there is also  a problem. A dipole model requires some kind of mechanism to facilitate  polarized coherence over a wider area of brain, than neuronal assembies. This section is going  to provide evidence and concepts to propose that the missing links in the above and this research can be explained by quick reacting Cortical ferrofluids which arise in the Subarachnoid layer and have binding properties capable of ferroelectic memory which can hold quantum &quot;style&quot; superpositions. Astrocytes are filled with  circulating cerebrospinal  fluid(422b) <em>and hemosiderin</em> a mixture of lipid and ferritin particles (414), which form the basis of the magnetite / ferrihydrite particles required for a ferrofluid. Although the  healthy brain surface is covered in these magnetic / lipid mixtures, So far they are researched as a disease by product.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style63"> LEFT : Binding properties of ferrofluids are immediately clear. RIGHT : Ferrofluids are capable of explaining cortical surface features such as gyri and collumns.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>FERROFLUIDS AND SHORT TERM MEMORY</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Satinovers &ldquo;The  Quantum brain&rdquo; (351) investigates the academically revered Ising, Hopfield and  von neumann models to reveal the ideal requirements for working memory in  consciousness.&nbsp; Magnetic cellular automata which mixes different kinds of  magnetic material into &ldquo;spin glass&rdquo; that can hold more than one memory.&nbsp; A material often a ferrofluid, &nbsp;is frustrated, because its larger structures, ferromagnetic  and antiferromagnetic compounds, are at odds with the strict order its iron  atoms require.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><span class="style63"><em>&ldquo;An array of ferromagnets subject to a  magnetic influence from the outside can store a memory-that&rsquo;s exactly what  happens when we use, say, Memorex audiotape to record a song.&nbsp; The tape is brown because the recording  surface is made of iron. But this kind of tape can only store one memory at a  time. In storing a new memory you erase the old one. A spin glass (</em>mixing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains)<em> however, can store many new memories at  once, just like a neural network and the brain, and it does so spontaneaously,  without being given any instructions. It is able to do this because a spin  glass array of magnets and antimagnets has more than one &ldquo;best&rdquo; arrangement.  Each such best arrangement can get connected to a different memory and store  it&rdquo;(351)</em></span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63"><img src="images/ferrihydrite-2.jpg" alt="d" width="575" height="162" border="3"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63">(1) spin glass antiferromagnet, the structure causes a continual  tug of movement within the molecule (2) Ferrihidyrite itself. (3) The flipping  within ferrihydrite creates its own hysteresis remamence (memory) (4) the other  required spin glass component, a magnetite ferrofluid. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The ideal  components for these multiple memories are a spin glass compromised of  ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic compounds. &nbsp;These two required elements for the spin glass  combination are exactly what had been found by researchers looking at the &nbsp;iron compounds coating the cortex in  alzheimers disease, (413, 414, 415) and at the centre of plaques and tangles.(395)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63"><em>&ldquo;a two-component system, consisting of  horse spleen ferritin (HoSF) which contains a 5&ndash;8&nbsp; nm sized antiferromagnetic ferrihydrite  (5Fe2O3&middot;9H2O) core and ferrimagnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (MNP) with  an average size of 10&ndash;20&nbsp; nm&rdquo;(395)</em></p>
              <p align="left" class="style15">SUPERPOSITIONAL  FERROFLUIDS AT BODY TEMPERATURE</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">At room  temperature, this combination of magnetic compounds bathed in CSF lipids have the properties of a spin glass ferrofluid with ferroelectric liquid crystal properties, (423)  Ferroelectrics are superior  to ferromagnetics for memory cells in computing (424) And ferroelectric  behavior in microtubules is sought after for quantum information processing  (422c)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63"><em>&ldquo;ferroelectric  order is possible but its existence is very sensitive to the dipole vector dimensionality  and the motion of the medium&hellip;The fluid  systems differ from the frozen case in that the strongly coupled translational  and rotational degrees of freedom are in full thermal equilibrium. This allows  the development of short range spatial correlations resembling those seen in  the ferroelectric tetragonal-I lattice&nbsp;  and, consequently, ferroelectric order develops in the liquid phase  (423)</em></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">While under an applied electric field, ferrofluids become solidified in  3ms and relax on field removal in up to 6.5ms (419d) They are capable of retaining  Multiple memories for associative memory (419c)&nbsp;  ideal for superposition.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><em>&nbsp;<span class="style63"><em>&ldquo;We analyse an  associative memory based on a ferrofluid, consisting of a system of magnetic  nano-particles suspended in a carrier fluid of variable viscosity subject to  patterns of magnetic fields from an array of input and output magnetic pads<strong> &hellip;.. Using </strong></em><strong><em>Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we demonstrate  that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of images, each  with an accuracy approaching 100%.&rdquo; (419c) </em>(recall occurred while fluid was frozen)</strong></span></em></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Ferrofluids, are a highly active area, being researched for  quantum computation when frozen (420,421,422). The requirements of  computer engineers, and what the brain needs are different things. There is  already some amount of coherence within CSF fluids (655), but at this stage its  not possible to say they provide any more coherence than magnetic particle  level coupling. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Even without the  small scale factor this still leaves a couple of possibilities for ferrofluids. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">1. They provide some kind of conductive coherence across the  brain surface to aid microscopic binding.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">2. They record cortical information in one or more layer  with enough coherence to grease conscious perception with larger scale binding  and magnetic particle resolution superposition. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>FERROFLUID LATENCY CORRELATES WITH LIMITS OF  PROCESSING</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Mri researchers have found atomic spin coherence in ventricular  matter of 300ms, (655) which is similar to the P300 decoherence time after  sensory input. Such coherence times within the CSF would be consistent with the  coherence of the proposed cortical ferrofluid. Other times correlate also </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The Geissler-Stroud-theory based on physiological  measurements, derived the temporal architecture of mental processes with a  universal constant of approximately 4.5 ms. (426) While under an applied  electric field, ferrofluids become solidified in 3ms (419d). Several  milliseconds preceding phase interactions between neuronal groups (which  have a high gamma limit of 4ms) are &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; mechanisms that modulate the  effective strength of a given connection (354) We can  tap a steady beat as low as 4ms adjust our tapping to compensate for variations of around 4ms and detect consciously timing  variations of around 6ms, (355) which is the relaxation time of a ferrofluid (419d) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The Ferrofluids  properties make it a liquid capable of maintaining super positioned  ferroelectric information at physiological temperature, and so are the proposed  memory properties of microtubles. The two could be compatible. Also as mentioned above the forces which govern the  synaptic strength of which microtubule structures are involved is still unknown  but correlate in both time (3ms) and location at the cortical surface.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">As proposed by Tuszynski microtubules are ideal for modulating long term memories. (657) Gamma synchrony would couple  both the ferrofluid and the microtubules This gives two ferroelectric systems locked together  to facilitate  superpositioned states covering a wider time span than  action potentials.&nbsp; Ferrofluid (short term, 3ms latency) and microtubule  (long term, high latency). </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>FERROFLUIDS AND BRAIN APPEARANCE</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/brain-appearance.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="206" border="3"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Considering the  above discussion on ferrofluids sandwiched to the brain surface its no surprise  when  looking at images of stripe domains&nbsp; ( <em>(which are photographs of&nbsp;  thin ferromagnetic strips, written to by an alternating magnetic field)</em> Writers have  commented on the similarity to cortical folds. (118, 120)&nbsp;&nbsp; The production  of Magnetic stripe domains (124) produces similar visual appearance to the perpendicular  anisotropic <em>(upwards direction)</em> domain ordering,  seen at both the surface of the brain and the cortical columns themselves. <strong>(1 and 2 in diagram above</strong>) . Even closer to our ferrofluid model, from the Caltech labs,  sandwiching a ferrofluid between two plates (like the subarachnoid space ?) and  applying an alternating current produces the same result. <strong>(3 in diagram above)</strong>. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">As for the &ldquo;magnetic&rdquo; shift, found in large  veins at the cortical surface (268,269) its no surprise, that in comparison to the  arteries,&nbsp; there is an increasingly  fractalised structure which is precisely aligned to the cortical domains  themselves,&nbsp; ( 4 in figure above) and why  the central sinus into which these veins converge at midline is toroidal, a  midline shape repeatedly found in dipole systems.( Is this tightness of veins to surface, the result of interaction between Deoxygenated blood and ferrofluid ?)  The fact that cortical folds scale with size through all  mammalian species suggest that they are related to a physical property that is  consistent such as that of magnetic compounds.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">NOTE: The following parts here provide a summary of  analysis of iron compounds in the brain, from the book section : &quot;Magnets in the brain&quot;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>INTRODUCTION TO MAGNETIC SUBSTANCES IN BIOLOGY</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Throughout this project I have taken great interest in a  series of iron compounds found to be coating the cortex. Discovered in 1992  through alzhiemer&rsquo;s research (and in abundance in normal brains also) they are thought  to be a waste by product which accumulates, eventually leading to  neurodegeneration.&nbsp; Magnetite and  ferrihydrite are superparamagnetic iron compounds found throughout the brain,  but mostly at the brain surface, and also regions associated with memory, such  as hippocampus and cerebellum. The rest of this section is a summary of detailed analysis of iron compounds in the brain.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><span class="style63"><em>&ldquo;Magnetite&hellip; a  ferrimagnetic mineral with chemical formula Fe3O4&hellip;.is the most magnetic of all  the minerals on Earth&hellip;&hellip;.Crystals of magnetite have been found in some bacteria  and in the brains of bees, of some birds (e.g., the pigeon), <strong>and of humans</strong>.&rdquo;</em> (143)</span></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/magnetite-small.jpg" width="575" height="165" border="3"></p>
              <p class="style64">Various forms of magnetite within nature. : LEFT : All these  examples were found within bacteria. &nbsp;MIDDLE  : the crystals form chains. RIGHT : Crystal from human hippocampus. So far, 3  billion magnetite particles have been found in the human brain. (53)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">As Magnetite, bound together in CSF lipids has the potential  to be the missing link for many areas of brain research, the first question is  how much of it do we have.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>CORTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF  MAGNETITE</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Magnetite is distributed in density throughout  the entire outer brain layer, in clumps of about 80 bio-mineralized crystals.  (24)&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63"><em>&ldquo;Grain sizes were bimodal,  with 62 of the 70 measured crystals in the 10 to 70nm range, and the remaining  8 with sizes ranging from 90 to 200 nm. Measurements in the TEM (electron  microscope) shadows from 62 of the smaller particles in one aggregate, yielded  an average size of 33 +- 15.2nm. Note that <strong>this  mean value must be biased towards the larger sized, because the extraction  procedure will discriminate against very small particles that move through the  liquid</strong>. Size and shape relationships for all measured particles fall within  the single-domain and super paramagnetic fields for magnetite. Crystal volume  estimates, done by assuming equant particle shapes, <strong>imply that the larger particles compose a maximum of&nbsp; around 85% of the magnetite</strong>. Using this  distribution we estimate that brain tissue contain a minimum of around  5,000,000 crystals per gram, distributed in the 50,000-100,000 discrete  clusters. Similarly, the meninges contain a minimum of 100 million crystals per  gram in 1-2,000,000 clusters.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (24)</em></p>

A good size for a ferrofluid.&nbsp; This  does not agree with the later statement that larger particles compose 85% of  the magnetite.&nbsp; The larger particles  represented 12% of the cluster with sizes from 90 to 200nm .&nbsp; Even with 12% at a large value of 150nm and  88% of the smaller particles at 25nm, the larger particles would represent only  50%. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>If the extraction  procedure discriminates against smaller particles, presumably the mean bias for  the smaller size group has to apply even more so to the larger group and the  mean for the large group should be adjusted towards an average size of 100nm.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A LIPID/MAGNETITE FERROFLUID</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">This section examines the distribution figures  to find if this is the correct magnitude to play a part in orientating the  basic cell units of cortical columns.&nbsp;  (35 Microns)&nbsp; (14, 255).&nbsp; &nbsp;Using the figures for  overall distribution, leptomeninges have a mean weight of 34.2 g, (172) This  makes for approx 3,420,000,000 cortical magnetite crystals divided by clusters  of 75 gives 45,600,000 cortical clusters.&nbsp;  This number would require more analysis of distribution of magnetite  within particular areas of the meninges. Also magnetite would be in the removed  pia layers which would contribute to the cortical surface total. The number of  approx 40,000,000 cortical magnetite clusters lies between current estimates  for the number of cortical minicolumns and hypercolumns 200,000,000 and 200,000  respectively. (255) So to fill out the greater numbers of particles required  for a useful cortical ferrofluid, a proposition will be made for a ferrofluid  mix consisting of both magnetite and ferrihydrite crystals <em>(which arises within lipid bound deposits of ferrihydrite called hemosiderin) </em>as well as larger and smaller magnetite crystals within siderosomes. Because  the cortical column is the smallest structural unit of cohesive neural function  there has to be a suitable brain lipid to space the limited number of particles  out to play a role in neuronal function. </p>

              <p align="justify" class="style16">There are many lipids in the CSF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of&nbsp;  these are transported by Albumin, a protein that is produced in the  choroids plexus. Albumin represents 3.5mg of CSF and&nbsp; (214) transports fatty acids  (&quot;free&quot; fatty acids).&nbsp;  (222)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style63">&ldquo;<em>Human cerebrospinal fluid  is an ultrafiltrate of plasma that is largely produced by the choroid plexus.  It consists of a mixture of anorganic salts, various sugars, lipids and  proteins from the surrounding brain tissues. <strong>The predominant proteins in cerebrospinal fluid are isoforms of serum  albumin, transferrin and immunoglobulins, representing more than 70% of the  total protein amount</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Magnetite lipids have already been developed  for medical use such as drug delivery, long before they were discovered in the  brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical engineers created &quot;magnetite cationic liposomes&quot;  (MCLs), which are cationic liposomes  containing 10-nm magnetite nanoparticles.&nbsp;  In these engineering experiments albumin secretion by liver cells  increased in response to the presence of the magnetite.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

              <p align="justify" class="style16">In the brain albumin is produced by the  choroid plexus. Would this increase in response to the brains own electromagnetic  forces ? Albumin itself has been used by medical engineers as a sealant for  magnetite,&nbsp; When it was discovered that  this protein solution dispersed in oil, and then heated produced solid,  spheroid albumin protein particles. The substance called polyacrolein contains  magnetite cores less than 25nm. These were produced for drug delivery.&nbsp; (220, 221)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">If these magnetic compounds play a large role in mammalian  short term memory, there could be implications for alzheimers as the first  symptom is loss of short term memory. Magnetic materials also undergo magnetic  ageing, (417, 415) losing their ability to retain information which may have  knock on effects within the brain itself.</p>
