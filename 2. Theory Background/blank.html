              <p align="justify" class="style64"><strong>SECTION ABSTRACT</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style80">The  final bit of the brain puzzle, the limbic system is analysed and correlates  well with a linear quadrupole. The inverse of a dipole.&nbsp; Further analysis of the limbic system with  linear multipoles such as quadrupoles are looked at in greater detail.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style80">Linear  Quadrupoles fire centrolineally to it&rsquo;s midline and are used for&nbsp; atomic clocks generation. The limbic system&rsquo;s  alternating wave EEG clocks, theta and delta are proposed to arise from the AC  structures which would occur at the midline of the quadrupole structure, where  the ventricles meet &nbsp;is involved in theta  generation, one of the brain&rsquo;s two governing clocks.&nbsp; The other alpha wave is generated also in the  thalamus at&nbsp; the brains midline. Also the  midline of quadrupoles is used for spectral measurement and&nbsp; analysis of small components. Computational  analysis of the thalamus find&rsquo;s that it performs spectral measurement of  incoming information for compression.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style80">The  limbic system is&nbsp; taken apart in a 3d  modeller and rebuilt &nbsp;as a linear  multipole. This multipole model is put back in context with the outer brain  dipole to get a greater idea how the whole brain operates as system. Putting  the dipole and quadrupole together creates an area of &ldquo;twist&rdquo; where the two  systems interact which explains the hippocampus formation.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style80">I  attempt to bring together a more complete model of limbic/cortical function by  studying the thalamocortical system, generator of alpha rhythm, with the septohippocampal system which generates theta.&nbsp; These two major systems  operate together  to generate the P300, a marker of perception and memory processes.&nbsp; John Aggleton&rsquo;s combined model of these two system,  along with John polich P300 model is used to make an initial proposal for  cortical/multipole brain structure. The limbic system is proposed to operate as  a harmonic oscillator entwined in a radiating cortex dipole. These are  continually involved in a limbic collapse/ cortical expansion cycle.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><strong>FINAL  PIECE OF THE PUZZLE</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">So far everything  most of this research has focussed on the cortex, but obviously the limbic system had to be looked  at.  What electromagnetic structure could the limbic system be, and does this  increase our understanding of the brain ?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The ventricles or  subarachnoid space have proven to be the solution for unravelling the cortex in  terms of where to find coherent charges, so I am putting these as a priority in  the limbic system. The solution with the most visual and structural  correlations to the ventricles is a linear quadrapole, which is interestingly  the same structure being used as an ion trap in quantum computers. When looking  at dissections of the limbic systems, nearly all its parts have smooth curves.  These also correlate quite well with Quadrupoles</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/linear.jpg" alt="w" width="575" height="325" border="3"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><strong>Correlation  of ventricles with a basic linear quadrapole</strong> : Theory predicts charge difference&nbsp; at lateral ventricles choroids plexus.  Sodium and chloride ions are produced here, which will have an effect on the polarization of neurotransmitters. Arrows indicate  proposed flow of charged fluid, consistent with quadrapole: Even through the skull  prevents the ventricles from completing their push to forming discs, the angle  and shape of the remaining pieces is consistent with quadrupole structure</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style70">A linear quadrupole  has an inwardly directed electromagnetic structure, due to it possessing  alternating charge at it&rsquo;s centre. This has almost reverse properties of a  dipole. A dipole spreads its field out, while a linear quadrupole is centrolineal.. it directs its field towards its center. In  the brain the quadrupoles centre is at the thalamus with the poles beginning at  each hippocampus. The quadrupoles use in industry is a means of electromagnetic  control, and physical co-ordination of ions. It&rsquo;s no surprise to see the  correlation, that the thalamus and hippocampus have such strong control of our  senses and memory. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/I10-80-limbic2.jpg" alt="w" width="575" height="366"></p>
              <p align="center" class="style16">LEFT : As the Quadrupole structure becomes more  complex each part can correspond to a facet of the limbic system. Although  limbic structure is complex, convoluted by the skull, and biological agendas,  it can still be accounted for with quadrupole patterns. Most of the structures  of the limbic system have the smooth curves and circular rotations associated  with linear quadrapoles</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The poles of the  brain quadrupole need to posess charge reversals of the cortical dipole,  otherwise the inner quadrapole would push the cortex dipole away. Again the  electromagnetic theory is consistent with brain structure. At the quadrupole centre the thalamus inputs  and outputs are twisted contralaterally so they switch round to the functions  of the cortex. The quadrapole and dipole poles meet at the hippocampus and temporal cortex. The  attraction of opposite charges each heading in opposite directions, tugs each  other into a twisted structure.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><img src="images/pole-explore.jpg" alt="w" width="575" height="338" border="3"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">Spectrometers which do chemical analysis have quadrapole to trap  ions using magnetic fields.&nbsp; <em>(1 and 2. in fig above) </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are we building computers in the image of  the brain ? &nbsp;hard to control quantum  computations uses a quadrapole ion trap <em>(3  in fig above) </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a spherical  representation of the thalamus and third ventricle<em>. (neuron matter areas are brown and ventricular blue) </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  thalamus is in the centre in between two lateral ventricles. <em>(blue)&nbsp; </em>On either side caudate nucleus has been fully rotated. <em>(4 in fig above)</em></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">Looking at the real ventricles. (6 in figure  above) The areas in green are choroids plexus of the lateral ventricles. These  produce the electrolyte CSF fluid.&nbsp; Do  the right and left lateral ventricles have different amounts of positive or  negative ions ? No research could be found regarding this, although they are  involved in Sodium and chloride ion production, producing quantities of sodium,  bicarbonate and chlorine for CSF fluid homeostasis.&nbsp; And this CSF Enters Astrocytes at lateral ventricles choroids plexus  (422b) Because of the amount of structurally  lateralized brain content found in the brain content of receptors,  neurotransmitters, neurons due to the charge distribution of the dipole. This theory  predicts the same for the limbic system. That the ion content&nbsp; at lateral ventricles choroids plexus has a  resultant effect on the neurochemistry of the area, and that alternating frequency  occurs where the lateral ventricles meet. This is borne out by studying the  septum, a thin membrane between the lateral ventricles. <em>(7 in fig above) </em>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><strong>SEPTUM  AS THE BRAINS GOVERNING CLOCK</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">The Medial  septum-diagonal band (MSDB) complex area plays a key role in brain wave  generation of the  theta  rythmns.(581,583, 587, 589) implicated  in attention and memory processes., (568 l, m ,n) The septohippocampal  projection system is the origin of acetylcholine neurons which tune modulations  throughout the limbic system (587)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">Septum is vital the the brain. In cats the septum is a modulator of P300,  (568a) . The P300' disappears after septal lesions (568b) and septal lesions  inhbit information gathering. (568d) Electrode Stimulation of the septum  between the two lateral ventricles induces orgasm. (568i) Also an  incomplete&nbsp; septum results in serious  brain disorders and epileptic seizures (568j, 568k)&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">&nbsp;The result of&nbsp;  developing with no septum is severe : </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16"><em>&ldquo;Absence of the septum pellucidum (ASP) is  a rare disorder characterized by abnormal development of a thin membrane  located at the midline of the brain. The disorder usually occurs with other  cranial abnormalities. Individuals with ASP may experience vision impairment or  blindness. They may also have coordination problems and hormone deficiencies  that result in short stature. Intelligence is usually affected and learning  disabilities are common. The disorder usually manifests early in life, often as  a consequence of discovering other abnormalities. Symptoms include involuntary  eye movements, a wasting of a part or parts of the body, and short stature.  Seizures and inappropriate behavior may also occur.&rdquo;</em> </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">Considering that it is not part of the hypothalamus and not  connected to physical function, why would a small area like the septum be so  vital to cognition ? &nbsp;All that marks it  out, is that it is a thin membrane separating the two lateral ventricles.  Looking at the limbic system predicted that it&rsquo;s structure would be  centrolineal tending towards an alternating current at as the lateral  ventricles meet. This is exactly what is found at the septum. A centre for  oscillations, Theta which is constant and dominate EEG to control  and co-ordinate the entire brains thinking activity.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><em>&ldquo;It has been speculated that  synchronous firing of neurons involved in working memory oscillate with  frequencies in the theta band (4 to 8 Hz). Indeed, the power of theta frequency  in the EEG increases with working memory load [47], and oscillations in the  theta band measured over different parts of the skull become more coordinated  when the <strong>person tries to remember</strong> the binding between two components of information [48].&rdquo;</em><strong> (</strong>565a)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><strong>SPHERICAL BRAIN MODELLING. </strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">As you will notice in the diagram above I have  started using quadrapole shapes to represent brain parts. In exploring visual  evidence (LINK)&nbsp; I try to show how  electromagnetism is trying to fulfil it&rsquo;s natural dipole type shapes, in spite  of the challenges of being inside a skull, and having all kinds of old  non-dipole bits attached or running through it.&nbsp;  Whatever structure is proposed for the limbic system will require  modelling. As it would take a lot of computation to twist and shear these  models to look like a brain. I will take a basic dipole shape like a toroid,  and show what happens when squashed and sheared.&nbsp; When a toroid undergoes a simple force such  as inward pull from the centre due to electromagnetic force along one axis, it  becomes flatter and concave.&nbsp; Because  there is such a large gap for the skulls eye throat and jaw region, the  electromagnetic forces within the it still have to move somewhere, so they move  back. This explains the horns of the third ventricles. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><img src="images/how-bits-get-like-this.jpg" alt="w" width="575" height="398" border="3"></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style16">The basic toroid shape in a 3d modeller. <em>(1 and 2. in fig  above) </em>is given a basic  shear command which tugs the structure from below <em>(3. in fig above</em>). A  pull like this would occur when a toroid is pulled from the central axis in a  normal quadrapole. The model then has the area subtracted where the Jaw and  spinal column occupy and allow no space, resulting in an area resembling the  right lateral ventricle. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><strong>REBUILDING A SPHERICAL  BRAIN</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">It&rsquo;s now possible using the 3d modeller to  build a complete spherical brain which accounts for all major neurology, using  only the basic dipole, quadrapole components of toroids, toroids sheared to  inverted lobes, hourglass isotrope&nbsp;  structures <em>(isotropes are standard  symmetrical hourglass dipole shapes)</em> and sheared hourglass isotropes which  look simiar to pairs of sheared toroids, but are joined.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">&nbsp;<img src="images/dipole-translation.jpg" alt="w" width="575" height="359" border="3"></p>

This is compromised from its  natural electromagnetic shapes by skull constraints. &nbsp;<em>(2 in  fig above)</em> This stack of shapes is an exploded view of the previously shown  limbic system. At the very centre is a flattened toroid (blue) which is the  central 3rd ventricle. Running through the centre of this and on  either side is a compressed hourglass isotrope forming the thalamus <em>(brown).</em> Surrounding that the lateral  ventricles <em>(blue)</em> which are sheared  toroids. Fitting into the ventricles a complete Caudate nucleus, a sheared  toroid <em>(brown).</em> <em>(5 in fig above)</em> A reminder of a similar linear quadrapole  structure. This image is taken from a standard simulation of a radio Dipole  antenna, illustrating both the hourglass and the effect of shear compression  when multiple isotropes occupy the same space. <em>(6 in fig above)</em>&nbsp; Back to  rebuilding the brain, the limbic region from fig 2 is reassembled and enclosed  within the white matter axons running from the thalamus, through the caudate  nucleus forming an hourglass shape <em>(white  in fig)</em> . Limitations of the modelling system used here need to be allowed  for. Globus Pallidus has been left out. The fully curved details of outer grey  matter are also absent. <em>(3 in fig above)</em>&nbsp; This is a simulation from MIT which shows an  inside view of toroid and field lines. These are quite common engineering  mockups. <em>(7 in fig above)</em>&nbsp; A reminder of what a section of the indusium  griseum looks like. This is in fact the other side of the hippocampus and runs  these toroid like tubes round the corpus Callosum (in a real brain). <em>(8 in fig above)&nbsp; </em>For the purpose of modelling a spherical  brain, the hippocampus piece which winds into the temporal lobe will be removed  and replaced by a complete set of toroids surrounding a now tube like Corpus  Callosum. <em>(9 in fig above)</em> A complete  brain widened in the centre. To reveal the usually hidden longitudinal  fissure.&nbsp; The white matter from the  corpus callosum is now wrapped&nbsp; round the  proposed inner limbic system isotrope modelled previously. <em>(6 in fig above)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

(575,574,573a)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">This dipole/quadrupole approach proposes that the  hippocampus twists into the cortex as a result of opposing charges between the  entorhinal cortex which has a neurochemical distribution that correlates with  an overall negative or hyper-polarizing tendency and the hippocampus which has  an overall positive or depolarizing tendency.

              <p align="left" class="style64">Finally If we are to make a serious attempt at proposing a dipole model then it must be  put together with in depth analysis of thalamo-cortical system and the EEG involved. In Section 5 I investigated the thalamocortical relationship and p300. Now it is going to be investigated further to see if it helps explain a dipole / Quadrupole interaction.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">The Thalamocortical  realtionship is defined as Oscillation-Assisted Processing&nbsp; Where sensory input modulates self generated  cortical activity (424x). In systems term the cortex is random and  chaotic (424u) with the thalamus in the control seat regulating&nbsp; cortico-cortico processes. Thalamocortical  inputs trigger a propagating envelope of gamma-band activity in auditory cortex  in while thalamic matrix nuclei are most strongly driven by corticothalamic  feedback &nbsp;(424x)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">In the view of&nbsp; Crick  and Koch controlled randomness is an appropriate mode of processing. <em>&ldquo;It is better to achieve a rapid but  occasionally imperfect performance instead of more prolonged one that always  produces a perfect result.&rdquo;</em> (424u)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">The  thalamus controls the cortex through Alpha waves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alpha waves are electromagnetic oscillations  in the frequency range of 8&ndash;12 Hz arising from synchronous and coherent (in  phase / constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in the  human brain&rdquo;&nbsp; (589) Sensory input from  the thalamus to cortex propagates gamma waves, local synchronized bursts of  activity that form transient neural assemblies which contribute to auditory  information processing (424w)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">What happen next can be measured by Event related  potential&nbsp; (ERP) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><em>&ldquo;Event Related Potentials (ERP) is any  stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus.

              <p align="justify" class="style64">What is the Event related potential ?&nbsp; Researchers have found it to be a combination  of very different processes and brain areas involved. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">Additive  i.e. a superposition. (411c)With each addition of evoked cortical low gamma  activity leading to &quot;desynchronization&rdquo; the Event related  desynchronization, (ERD) a reduction of fast non-phase-locked oscillations  (402). A &ldquo;decrease in coherence across space&rdquo; (5751) Alpha (ERS) suppression,  or deactivation &nbsp;(402) &nbsp;In other words there is an increasing  divergence away from a coherent thalamic entrained signal as more cortical  areas are activated by stimulus. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">ERD  onset is positively associated with P300 latency &ndash; and &nbsp;negatively  associated with P300 amplitude (402) &nbsp;&nbsp;In other words faster increases in  superpositional cortical activation, lead to quicker and higher power ERP&rsquo;s.  Lower latency ERP&rsquo;s such as P1-N1 (100ms) complex are due to the superposition  of cortical evoked oscillations. (411c) &nbsp;while higher latency N400 (400ms) is initially  associated with Thalamic generated Alpha wave phase reset, (402, 575a) without  power increase (411d) &nbsp;Phase  resetting the other process involved in ERP generation is common to non-linear  oscillatory systems in response to a perturbation (401b3) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">P300  precedes ERD and predicted individual variance of both slow and fast alpha ERD.  P300 and ERD are related such that slow and fast alpha ERDs are specifically guided  or modified by the internal event(s) indexed by P300. (401c) ERD could  therefore index the effects of cognitive operations on alpha activity power and  frequency (402) </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">At this  stage here is summary of ERP&rsquo;s function.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64"><em>&ldquo;Our results on ERPs agree with  the data of Sergent et al. (2005), which suggests that ERPs evoked by perceived  and unperceived stimuli start to diverge around 270 ms. Interestingly, these  ERP differences occur only after the end of the transient increase in phase  synchrony. Thus<strong>, it seems as if the fast  and transient large-scale synchronization enhances the saliency of the  activation patterns sufficiently to permit access to consciousness and thereby  triggers a sequence of processes such as perception stabilization, maintenance  in working memory, and generation of expectancies that are associated with  conscious awareness</strong>&rdquo; </em>(408a)]</p>

As The P300 is accompanied by Alpha phase reset&nbsp; (411d) and Alpha wave phase reset Contributes to the Generation of ERPs (, 402, 575a) it could be hypothesized that this reset  occurs due to the corticothalamic input. &nbsp;The thalamic nuclei targeted by corticothalamic input are matrix relay, as one  function of this pattern is to synchronize fast cortical oscillations via the  matrix projections back to cortex.(424x)&nbsp;  The limbic / cortical relationship cycle, here appears to be sensory input  leads to cortical expansion and superposition. The resulting decoherence  increases corticothalamic feedback, with a reciprocal thalamic alpha phase relocking.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">This control of superpositioned wave activity is what  generates the P300, however the P300 is composed of both phase-locked  delta&nbsp; and theta-range synchronized  oscillations (402) A composition of Theta / delta locked oscillations mean that  the septohippocampal system is working in conjunction with the corticothalamic system. </p>

Like  most of the areas researched, more and more questions are answered by this  model, because if the brain structure is defined accurately then any process  and content of the brain should face little problem when put into a brain  multipole.

                From the view of the Quadrupole collapse /  Dipole expansion model above. <em>(Quadrupole  is the shape with the arrows on its axis) </em>&nbsp;Everything here translates well with the  previously investigated neuroscience. &nbsp;A  quadrupole is centrolineal, it&rsquo;s products such as thalamus and hippocampus  drive linear processes towards the centre where they synchronise into AC waves or  phase locked combinations of their respective Theta, Delta and Alpha waves.  (middle wave in yellow, and also at bottom middle of diagram)&nbsp; The Quadrupole&rsquo;s phase locking enforces  coherence and co-ordinates brain activity with repeated synchronization  signals.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style64">In the cortex  it is proposed that gamma oscillations only evolved due to potentials hitting the surface of the brain and being driven back down to meet the inhibitory thalamocortical matrix projections <span class="style79">(426a4b).</span> That is if the cortex were not sealed there would be no gamma oscillation. It is entirely a radiative structure. Nunez a respected neuroscientist in eeg has  proposed that the cortex can best be understood in terms of wave like activity at the brain surface,  inducing standing waves.(330)  To summarize, this supports the view that all coherent brain oscillation originate from or is dictated by the limbic quadrupole, with  the remaining cortical gamma oscillations, are explained by chaotic feedback (653a), due to it being a dissipitave dipole, enclosed within a skull.</p>

Different researchers point out (700,705,424u) that the differences between cortical and thalamic EEG are linear and non linear respectively, and that having the right balance between these two systems is an essential part of succesfull brain function (705,424u,424q)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style64">The outwards flowing structure of  the cortex tends towards expansion, chaos, non linearity and environmental  interaction spawning ripples and wave packets at it&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp; The limbic system is the converse with an  inward directing collapsing structure that tends towards linearity, order and  control of the cortex through repeated alternating phase locking signals that  originate where the two inner ventricles join together.&nbsp; This Expand / Collapse interaction is  essential if the brains full computational processes are to be understood</p>
